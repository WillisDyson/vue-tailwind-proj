# Vue.js and Tailwind CSS "URL shortener" project
A sample project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G) which uses Vue.js (and Tailwind CS for styling). The app uses Axios to fetch data from the [Clean URL API](https://cleanuri.com/docs).

## Hosted version (backend not connected)
If you wish to see a live preview without downloading any files, you can find it here: https://lucky-selkie-2ea4b2.netlify.app/

*Note that the backend is not connected, so URL-shortening functionality won't work. If you wish to see full functionality, please refer to the instructions below.

## Running the app locally (with backend connected)
1. Download all of the project files
2. Open your CLI and run "cd vue-tailwind-proj/vue-tailwind-app"
3. Run "npm run build"
4. Open another CLI window, and run "cd vue-tailwind-proj/vue-tailwind-app/url-shortener-backend"
5. Run "node server.cjs"
6.  Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173/

Both the frontend and backend should now be running, and the URL shortening functionality should work correctly.
